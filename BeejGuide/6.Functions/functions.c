/*
Passing by Value:
    when you pass a value to a function, a **copy** of that value gets made in the stack
    note that C specification doesn't say anything about a stack.
Passing by Reference:
    that's how Java/Python works. In C, you need to explicit claim it is a pointer in the function parameters

Prototypes:
    notify the complier in advance that you will be using a function of a certain type that has a certain parameter
    list and that way the function can be defined anywhere at all, as long as the function prototype has been decalared first
