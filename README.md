## Virtues and Challenges

### Virtues

* **Fast**, since it is a compiled language and it is "close" to the machine hardware.
* **Portable**, since you can compile the program to run on just about any hardware platform.
* **Small**, in terms of its size compared with C++.
* **Mature**, a long history and lots of resource and experience.
* **Direct Access to Memory**, malloc().
* **Low-level System Feature Available**.

### Challenges

* Easiness level.
* Manage memory yourself.
* Verboseness.
* No Object-Oriented Programming.
* No runtime checking.
